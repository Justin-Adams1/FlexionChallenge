# FlexionChallenge
This is the coding challenge that I'm completing as part of Flexion's Apprenticeship Program.

- To get started with this application, please clone a copy of the directory from :
    https://github.com/Justin-Adams1/FlexionChallenge
- Once you have a copy in your local machine, open up the flexionchallenge folder with Visual Studio Code.
- Once you have it opened, click on Terminal, New Terminal.
- Once you are in the terminal, type "npm start" and a web browser page should pop up, with the application.

Here are 5 things that I would work on next to improve this solution:

1. I would make the test length dynamic, and able to be selected by the teacher at the start of each grading session. I went with 5 for this iteration to make sure I could successfully complete the challenge first. 
2. I would add an ability to save the test digitally to integrate into their grade book in an easy format. 
3. I would add more conversions into the choices, so that this tool could be used in a wider range. 
4. My code is currently very 'hard-coded'. I would trim up my code to get rid of repetitions.
5. Right now, its not very easy to access my SPA solution. The description of the problem mentioned that the science teachers are comfortable around a command line, but I worry that this still might be a little too involved for them.
